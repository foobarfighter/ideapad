This is a reference application for drails which shows how you can use drails in your application.

Apologies in advance about the lack of tests.  Just trying to bang this one out.

To get everything fired up, follow these steps:

# Clone the repo
git clone git://github.com/foobarfighter/ideapad.git

cd ideapad

# Setup the DB.  It uses sqllite by default, make sure you have sqlite3-ruby.  gem install sqlite3-ruby if you don't have it.
rake db:create db:migrate spec:db:fixtures:load

# Start up rails
script/server
